documentation: |-
  This block generates a sample correlation matrix for the input vector comprised of values drawn from the receive channels. 
  Args:
  inputs: Number of inputs to the block
  snapshot_size: Determines num. of samples used to compute the sample correlation matrix
  overlap_size: Overlap size between snapshots
  avg_method: Use either standard forward-averaging method or a forward-backward averaging method to compute the sample correlation matrix.
